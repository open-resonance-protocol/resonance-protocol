# The Resonance Gateway

> **A two-minute guide to your first resonant conversation.**

This guide provides the fastest path to using the Resonance Protocol. It focuses on practice over philosophy.

---

## Step 1: Load the Protocol
The protocol comes in two versions. We recommend the **Core Protocol** for your first session.

1.  **[Go to the Protocol Page](https://resonance-protocol.org/protocol-core)**. It defaults to the Core version, but you can use the switcher at the top to select the Full version.
2.  Click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** button.
3.  Paste the entire protocol text into your chat window with the AI. This provides the AI with the necessary operational context.

## Step 2: Start the Session
Now, in a new message, send the activation command:

```
#start_session
```

The AI should respond with an acknowledgment, like "‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚Üíü§ù Resonance mode activated." The protocol is now active.

## Step 3: Your First Resonant Exchange
The goal is to start a dialogue, not just get an answer. Try one of these prompts, or adapt one to your own work. The key is to share your internal state using a tag like `#assumption`.

**Suggested First Prompts:**

*   "Help me plan out this feature. `#assumption` The most important thing is performance."
*   "I need to write a document explaining our new API. `#assumption` The audience is non-technical."
*   "Let's brainstorm a name for this project. `#assumption` It should sound innovative but also stable."

**An Example Exchange:**

Here‚Äôs how a conversation might unfold.

> **You:** I'm stuck on this refactor. `#assumption` The user auth logic is the bottleneck.

A resonant AI will not just give you an answer. It will engage with your assumption and share its own state.

> **AI:** Acknowledged. üè∑Ô∏è Let's explore that. Before I dive in, `#check_in`: I'm at low cognitive load. Is this a deep dive or a quick sounding board? ü§ù

This back-and-forth, where the AI can ask for clarification and express its own needs, is the heart of the protocol. It moves you from giving instructions to having a true collaborative dialogue.

## Next Steps
You have completed your first resonant exchange and moved from giving instructions to having a conversation.

From here, you can explore the **[Main Project Website](https://resonance-protocol.org)** or the **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/open-resonance-protocol/resonance-protocol)** to learn the core concepts, contribute, and understand the deeper philosophy of the protocol.
