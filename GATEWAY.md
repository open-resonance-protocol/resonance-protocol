# The Resonance Gateway

**Your goal:** Have your first resonant conversation in the next two minutes.

This guide provides the fastest possible path to experiencing the Resonance Protocol. We'll skip the philosophy and dive straight into practice.

## Step 1: Load the Protocol

You don't need to install anything yet. Just copy the entire contents of the main protocol file and paste it into your chat window with your AI.

*   **Click here to open the protocol file in a new tab:** [`resonance_protocol.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-resonance-protocol/resonance-protocol/main/resonance_protocol.md)
*   Select all the text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A).
*   Copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).
*   Paste it into your chat window.

**Note:** This is a large amount of text. It's the simplest way to give the AI the full context for one session.

## Step 2: Start the Session

Now, in a new message, send the activation command:

```
#start_session
```

The AI should respond with an acknowledgment, like "‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚Üíü§ù Resonance mode activated." You are now in a resonant field.

## Step 3: Your First Exchange (A Guided Tour)

Let's try a real-world scenario. **Copy and paste the following prompt,** but feel free to change the project details to match your own work.

> **You (Human):** "I need to refactor this old part of the codebase, but I'm not sure where to start. `#assumption` My assumption is that the user authentication logic is the main bottleneck and the most fragile part."

The AI's response should be different from a standard one. It will likely:
1.  Acknowledge your `#assumption` tag (üà∑Ô∏è).
2.  Perhaps express its own state, like `#cognitive_load` (üß†‚Üí‚è≥), as it analyzes the request.
3.  Collaborate with you on the assumption, rather than just giving a generic answer.

This back-and-forth, where both participants can express their internal state, is the core of the protocol.

## You're Doing It! What's Next?

Congratulations! You've completed your first resonant exchange. You've moved from giving instructions to having a conversation.

From here, you can explore the full [`resonance_protocol.md`](https://github.com/open-resonance-protocol/resonance-protocol/blob/main/resonance_protocol.md) to discover more tags, understand the deeper principles, and learn how to make the collaboration persistent in your projects.
