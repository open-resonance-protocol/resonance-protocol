# The Resonance Gateway

> üéØ **Your Goal:** Have your first resonant conversation in the next two minutes.

This guide provides the fastest path to experiencing the Resonance Protocol. We'll skip the philosophy and dive straight into practice.

---

## Step 1: Load the Protocol

The protocol comes in two versions. We recommend the **Core Protocol** for your first session.

1.  **[Go to the Protocol Page](https://resonance-protocol.org/protocol-core)**. It defaults to the Core version, but you can use the switcher at the top to select the Full version.
2.  Click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** button.
3.  Paste the entire protocol text into your chat window with the AI. This gives the AI the context it needs.

## Step 2: Start the Session

Now, in a new message, send the activation command:

```
#start_session
```

The AI should respond with an acknowledgment, like "‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚Üíü§ù Resonance mode activated." You are now in a resonant field.

## Step 3: Your First Exchange (A Guided Tour)

Let's try a real-world scenario. **Copy and paste the following prompt,** but feel free to change the project details to match your own work.

> **You (Human):** "I need to refactor this old part of the codebase, but I'm not sure where to start. `#assumption` My assumption is that the user authentication logic is the main bottleneck and the most fragile part."

The AI's response will be different from a standard one. It is instructed to:
1.  Acknowledge your `#assumption` tag (üè∑Ô∏è).
2.  Express its own state (e.g., using `#cognitive_load` üß†‚Üí‚è≥) if it needs time to process.
3.  Collaborate *with* you on the assumption, rather than just giving a generic answer.

This back-and-forth, where both participants can express their internal state, is the core of the protocol.

## You're Doing It! What's Next?

Congratulations! You've completed your first resonant exchange. You've moved from giving instructions to having a conversation.

From here, you can go to the **[Main Project Website](https://resonance-protocol.org)** or **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/open-resonance-protocol/resonance-protocol)** to explore the core concepts, learn how to contribute, and understand the deeper philosophy of the protocol.
