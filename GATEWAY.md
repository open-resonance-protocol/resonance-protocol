# The Resonance Gateway

> **A two-minute guide to your first resonant conversation.**

This guide provides the fastest path to using the Resonance Protocol. It focuses on practice over philosophy.

---

## Step 1: Load the Protocol

The protocol comes in two versions. We recommend the **Core Protocol** for your first session.

1.  **[Go to the Protocol Page](https://resonance-protocol.org/protocol-core)**. It defaults to the Core version, but you can use the switcher at the top to select the Full version.
2.  Click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** button.
3.  Paste the entire protocol text into your chat window with the AI. This provides the AI with the necessary operational context.

## Step 2: Start the Session

Now, in a new message, send the activation command:

```
#start_session
```

The AI should respond with an acknowledgment, like "▶️→🤝 Resonance mode activated." The protocol is now active.

## Step 3: Your First Exchange

Let's try a real-world scenario. **Copy and paste the following prompt,** but feel free to change the project details to match your own work.

> **You (Human):** "I need to refactor this old part of the codebase, but I'm not sure where to start. `#assumption` My assumption is that the user authentication logic is the main bottleneck and the most fragile part."

The AI's response will be different from a standard one. It is instructed to:
1.  Acknowledge your `#assumption` tag (🏷️).
2.  Express its own state (e.g., using `#cognitive_load` 🧠→⏳) if it needs time to process, or use `#clarification_pause` (🌊→🎯) to ask for more detail.
3.  Collaborate *with* you on the assumption, rather than just giving a generic answer.

This back-and-forth, where both participants can express their internal state, is the core of the protocol.

## Next Steps

You have completed your first resonant exchange and moved from giving instructions to having a conversation.

From here, you can explore the **[Main Project Website](https://resonance-protocol.org)** or the **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/open-resonance-protocol/resonance-protocol)** to learn the core concepts, contribute, and understand the deeper philosophy of the protocol.
